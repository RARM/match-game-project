# Match Game Project
Personal project part of the [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) course: _Build a Website form Scratch_.

This repository is only expository, as part of my portfolio.

#### Check The Code
Check the code in the [`src`](https://github.com/RARM/match-game-project/tree/master/src) folder; it is pure `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`. It was also built using Bootstrap.

This is one of my first web projects. Check [my website](https://rodolfo.pro) for more recent projects.
